# Glucose-Percentile
Introduction
A percentile is a number denoting the position of a data point within a numeric dataset by indicating the percentage of the data points with an equal or lesser (assuming it’s inclusive) value. Percentiles can be used to understand test scores, stock values, health indicators, and other values. This week, we will use them to look at blood glucose measurements. 

In the United States, 11.6% of the population has diabetes. For those with diabetes, it’s important to manage their blood glucose (or blood sugar) levels. In the United States, blood glucose levels are measured in mg/dL (milligrams per deciliter). The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends a target range of 80 to 180 mg/dL. Today, many people (diabetic or otherwise) wear a CGM (continuous glucose monitor) to get blood sugar readings every few minutes. Since blood sugar changes as we eat, it’s helpful to look at data based upon the time of day or in relation to meal time. That is what we are visualizing this week. We are looking at measurements for multiple days and visualizing percentiles for each time of day with reference lines overlaid to show where values are in or out of range. The visual below is created from the line chart core visual – no custom visuals needed.
